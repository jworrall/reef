/**
 * <p>
 *   Service for retrieving entity relationships and storing/retrieving entity attributes.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 *   Note: Many terms for this section are take from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph theory</a>.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 *   The EntityService provides access to the system model. The model is both the pool of
 *   "entities" and the relationships (edges) connecting those entities to each other.
 *   Entity types include: Agent, Substations, EquipmentGroup, Breaker, Point, etc.
 *   Two entities may be related by more than one type of relationship (examples: owns,
 *   feedback, etc.)</p>
 *
 * <p>
 *   The specific entities and relationships modeled in a particular reef installation
 *   depends on what the system is being used for (ex: SCADA, Hydro, Microgrid, etc.).</p>
 *
 * <p>
 *   Many of the entities in the "entity pool" have more specific type information beyond Entity.
 *   An example is Point. There is an Entity representation of a point that is used to
 *   describe logical relationships to equipment and commands. At the same time, there is a Point
 *   representation available through the PointService that includes added data like whether that
 *   point is currently abnormal etc. Clients are expected to use the more specific services for
 *   basic relationship queries and to retrieve the detailed information available for each specific type. The
 *   EntityService is available for more complex queries that select objects based on the the many
 *   relationships between entities. Once these entities are returned, the client can use the
 *   type specific services to get more type-specific information.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 *   Examples of relationship types (colors)  are:</p>
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>owns - used in power systems to model how points and commands are logically considered to be parts of equipment</li>
 *     <li>feedback - denotes which Points are affected by which Commands</li>
 *     <li>source - denotes the data provider for a Point or Command (communication pathway)</li>
 *   </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * In each installation of Reef there are a further set of constraints applied over this basic model that make the model
 * easier to consume and reason about, there should be accompanying documentation that describe what those constraints
 * are. In a future release those constraints will themselves be queryable so applications can be more self configuring,
 * Currently the developer needs to have a decent idea as to the model to construct a useful query.</p>
 *
 * Tag for api-enhancer, do not delete: !api-definition!

     * Return a tree of entities based on a complex entity model query. It is usually possible to satisfy most entity requirements

     * entities. A tree query assumes you have a single parent node that you are basing the request on. Use getEntities

     *   The edges of one color (ex: all "owns" edges) will form a tree (no cyclic dependencies).

     *   "source" edge to the communication device that is measuring that value. Edges are transitive
     *   so if A -> "owns" -> B and B -> "owns" -> C therefore A -> "owns" -> C. To differentiate
     *   between a "direct" edge and a transitive edge we use the concept of "distance". The distance
     *   from A -> B and B -> C would be 1, between A -> C would be 2. This distance can be explicitly
     *   specified to constrain queries. All edges have a direction, so in the previous example it would
     *   be said "A owns B" and "B is owned by A". The "descendant_of" field in the proto can be
     * used to set this direction, true means get children ("A owns B"), false means get parents ("B is owned by A").</p>
